// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Read n
IF n%2==0 THEN 
	PRINT "EVEN"
ELSE 
	PRINT "ODD"
END IF
STOP

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Begin
WRITE "Please enter 5 numbers"
READ num1
READ num2
READ num3
READ num4
READ num5
Sum = num1+num2+num3+num4+num5
Avg = Sum/5
FIND Minimum Number
min = num1
	IF num2 < min
		min = num2
	ELSE min = unchanged
	IF num3 < min
		min = num3
	ELSE min = unchanged
	IF num4 < min
		min = num4
	ELSE min = unchanged
	IF num5 < min
		min = num5
	ELSE min = unchanged
FIND Maximum Number
max = num1
	IF num2 > max
		max = num2
	ELSE max = unchanged
	IF num3 > max
		max = num3
	ELSE max = unchanged
	IF num4 > max
		max = num4
	ELSE max = unchanged
	IF num5 > max
		max = num5
	ELSE max = unchanged

		
WRITE "Average is (Avg), Lowest value is (min), and Highest value is (max)"
